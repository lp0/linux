Broadcom BCM63xx-style Level 2 timer interrupt controller

This block is a timer controller that is connected to one interrupt on the L1
controller and functions as an interrupt controller for timers.

- 3 independent timers with their own maskable level interrupt bit (but not
  per CPU because there is only one parent interrupt and the timers share it)

- 1 watchdog timer with and unmaskable level interrupt

- Contains one enable/status word pair

- No atomic set/clear operations

The lack of per CPU ability of timers makes them unusable as a set of
clockevent devices, otherwise they could be attached to the remaining
interrupts.

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "brcm,bcm63xx-timer"
- reg: specifies the base physical address and size of the registers;
  the number of supported IRQs is fixed at 4
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an interrupt
  source, should be 1.
- interrupt-parent: specifies the phandle to the parent interrupt controller(s)
  this one is cascaded from
- interrupts: specifies the interrupt line(s) in the interrupt-parent controller
  node; valid values depend on the type of parent interrupt controller

Example:

timer: timer@0x10000080 {
        compatible = "brcm,bcm63xx-timer";
        reg = <0x10000080 0x0c>;

        interrupt-controller;
        #interrupt-cells = <1>;

        interrupt-parent = <&periph_intc>;
        interrupts = <0>;
        clocks = <&periph_clk>;
};
