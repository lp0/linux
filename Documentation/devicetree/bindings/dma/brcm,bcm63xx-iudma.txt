* BCM63xx IUDMA controller

The BCM63xx IUDMA controller has 8, 16 or 32 channels, with one IRQ
per channel.

This is shared by different peripherals which will all provide their
own IUDMA interface registers but with only the channels and IRQs
they require (indexed from 0).

Supported chip variants:
	8 channels: 6345
	16 channels: 3368, 6338, 6348, 6358
	32 channels: 6318, 6328, 6368, 63168, 63268, 6816, 68280

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "brcm,bcm<chip>-iudma".
- reg: Should contain the IUDMA registers location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain the IUDMA interrupts associated
		with the IUDMA channels in ascending order.
- #dma-cells: Must be <1>, the cell in the dmas property of the
		client device represents the DMA channel.

Example:

enetdma0: dma-controller@0x1000d800 {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm63168-iudma";
	reg = <0x1000d800 0x600>;
	interrupt-parent = <&periph_intc>;
	interrupts = <1>, <64>, <2>, <65>, <3>, <66>, <4>, <67>;
	#dma-cells = <1>;
	dma-channels = <8>;
	dma-requests = <512>;
	status = "disabled";
};

DMA clients connected to the BCM63xx IUDMA controller must use the format
described in the dma.txt file, using a two-cell specifier for each channel.

Example:

enetsw0: ethernet@0x10700000 {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm63168-enetsw";
	reg = <0x10700000 0x10000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&periph_intc>;
	interrupts = <48>;
	clocks = <&periph_clk 10>;
	reset = <&perf_soft_rst 4>;
	power-supply = <&power_robosw>;
	dmas = <&enetdma0 0	/* read channel */
		&enetdma0 1	/* write channel */
		&enetdma0 2	/* read channel */
		&enetdma0 3	/* write channel */
		&enetdma0 4	/* read channel */
		&enetdma0 5	/* write channel */
		&enetdma0 6	/* read channel */
		&enetdma0 7>;	/* write channel */
	dma-names = "rx", "tx", "rx", "tx", "rx", "tx", "rx", "tx";
	brcm,phy-ids = <1>, <2>, <3>, <4>;
	brcm,port-names = "fe2", "fe3", "fe4", "fe1";
	status = "disabled";
};
