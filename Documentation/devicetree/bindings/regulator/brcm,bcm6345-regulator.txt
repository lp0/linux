Broadcom BCM6345 regulator

The BCM6345 has one or more registers with bits that act as regulators
to enable/disable power to individual chip peripherals.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "brcm,bcm<soc>-regulator", "brcm,bcm6345-regulator";
- regmap: regmap phandle to use for enable control
- offset: register offset
- mask: register enable mask
- startup-delay-us: startup time in microseconds

Any property defined as part of the core regulator
binding, defined in regulator.txt, can also be used.

However the regulator is expected to have the same values
for regulator-min-microvolt and regulator-max-microvolt.

Example:

misc: syscon@10001800 {
	compatible = "syscon";
	reg = <0x10001800 0xd0>;
};

robosw_power: robosw {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm63168-regulator", "brcm,bcm6345-regulator";
	regulator-name = "robosw_power";
	regmap = <&misc>;
	offset = <0x4c>;
	mask = <0x40>;
	startup-delay-us = <100000>;
};
