Broadcom BCM6345 clocks

This binding uses the common clock binding:
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

The BCM6345 contains clocks gated with a register. Clocks are indexed
by bits in the register and are active high. Most MIPS-based BCM63xx
SoCs have a clock gating set of registers, but some have clock gate bits
interleaved with other status bits and configurable clocks in the same
register.

Required properties:
- compatible:         Should be "brcm,bcm<soc>-gate-clk", "brcm,bcm6345-gate-clk"
- #clock-cells:       Should be <1>.
- regmap:             The register map phandle
- offset:             Offset in the register map for the clock register (in bytes)
- clocks:             The external oscillator clock phandle
- clock-indices:      The bits in the register used for gated clocks.
- clock-output-names: Should be a list of strings of clock output signal
                      names indexed by the clock indices.

Example:

periph_clk: periph_clk {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm63168-gate-clk", "brcm,bcm6345-gate-clk";
	regmap = <&periph_cntl>;
	offset = <0x4>;

	#clock-cells = <1>;
	clock-indices =
		<1>,          <2>,        <3>,       <4>,     <5>,
		<6>,          <7>,        <8>,       <9>,     <10>,
		<11>,         <12>,       <13>,      <14>,    <15>,
		<16>,         <17>,       <18>,      <19>,    <20>,
