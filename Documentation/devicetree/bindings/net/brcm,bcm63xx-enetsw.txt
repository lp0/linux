* BCM63xx Ethernet Switch

The BCM63xx Ethernet Switch has up to 8 physical ports, and a virtual
port representing the host itself. It uses the BCM63xx IUDMA controller
to send/receive packets.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "brcm,bcm<chip>-enetsw", "brcm,bcm63xx-enetsw".
- reg: Should contain the enetsw registers location and length.
- clocks: Should contain the clocks required for operation.
- reset: Should contain the reset controller device for soft reset.
- power-supply: Should contain the regulator required to power the chip.
- dmas: Should contain two DMA channels, one for RX and one for TX.
- dma-names: Should be "rx" and "tx" for the RX and TX channels.
- brcm,phy-ids: Should contain the hardware PHY IDs for up to 8 ports
      in the order they are present on the hardware.
- brcm,port-names: Should contain the names of the ports in the same
      order as the brcm,phy-ids. Use an empty port name for ports
      that should be ignored. These will be disabled and not forward
      traffic.

Optional properties:
- interrupts: Should contain the interrupt to use for PHY status changes.

Example:

enetsw0: ethernet@10700000 {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm63168-enetsw", "brcm,bcm63xx-enetsw";
	reg = <0x10700000 0x10000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&periph_intc>;
	interrupts = <48>;
	clocks = <&periph_clk 10>;
	reset = <&periph_soft_rst 4>;
	power-supply = <&power_robosw>;
	dmas = <&enetdma0 0	/* read channel */
		&enetdma0 1>;	/* write channel */
	dma-names = "rx", "tx";
	brcm,phy-ids = <1>, <2>, <3>, <4>;
	brcm,port-names = "fe2", "fe3", "fe4", "fe1";
};
