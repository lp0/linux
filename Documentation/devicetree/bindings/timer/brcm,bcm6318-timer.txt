Broadcom BCM6318 Timer

This block is a timer that is connected to multiple interrupts on the main
interrupt controller and functions as a programmable interrupt controller for
timer events. There is a main timer interrupt for all timers.

- 4 independent timers with their own interrupt, and own maskable level
  interrupt bit in the main timer interrupt

- 1 watchdog timer with an unmaskable level interrupt bit in the main timer
  interrupt

- Contains one enable/status word pair

- No atomic set/clear operations

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "brcm,bcm<soc>-timer", "brcm,bcm6318-timer"
- reg: specifies the base physical address and size of the registers, excluding
  the watchdog registers
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an interrupt
  source, should be 1.
- interrupt-parent: specifies the phandle to the parent interrupt controller(s)
  this one is cascaded from
- interrupts: specifies the interrupt line(s) in the interrupt-parent controller
  node for the main timer interrupt, followed by the individual timer
  interrupts; valid values depend on the type of parent interrupt controller
- clocks: phandle of timer reference clock (periph)

Example:

timer: timer@10000040 {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm63148-timer", "brcm,bcm6318-timer";
	reg = <0x10000040 0x28>;

	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;

	interrupt-parent = <&periph_intc>;
	interrupts = <31>, <0>, <1>, <2>, <3>;
	clock = <&periph_osc>;
};
