Broadcom BCM6345 Timer

This block is a timer that is connected to one interrupt on the main interrupt
controller and functions as a programmable interrupt controller for timer
events.

- 3 independent timers with their own maskable level interrupt bit (but not
  per CPU because there is only one parent interrupt and the timers share it)

- 1 watchdog timer with an unmaskable level interrupt

- Contains one enable/status word pair

- No atomic set/clear operations

The lack of per CPU ability of timers makes them unusable as a set of
clockevent devices, otherwise they could be attached to the remaining
interrupts.

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "brcm,bcm<soc>-timer", "brcm,bcm6345-timer"
- reg: specifies the base physical address and size of the registers, excluding
  the watchdog registers
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an interrupt
  source, should be 1.
- interrupt-parent: specifies the phandle to the parent interrupt controller(s)
  this one is cascaded from
- interrupts: specifies the interrupt line(s) in the interrupt-parent controller
  node for the timer interrupt; valid values depend on the type of parent
  interrupt controller
- clocks: phandle of timer reference clock (periph)

Example:

timer: timer@10000080 {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm63168-timer", "brcm,bcm6345-timer";
	reg = <0x10000080 0x1c>;

	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;

	interrupt-parent = <&periph_intc>;
	interrupts = <0>;
	clock·=·<&periph_osc>;
};
